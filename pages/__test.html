            I can't stop listening. Every time I hear one of their songs - the
            vocals - it gives me goosebumps. Shivers straight down my spine. What a
            beautiful expression of creativity. Can't get enough.

            I feel blessed to have seen them in person. What a show! They were just
            perfection. If there was one day of my life I could relive, this would
            be it. What an incredible day.

        This is art. This is inexplicable magic expressed in the purest way,
        everything that makes up this majestic work deserves reverence. Let us
        appreciate this for what it is and what it contains.
